highdimensional streaming datasets are ubiquitous in modern applications examples range from nance and ecommerce to the study of biomedical and neuroimaging data as a result many novel algorithms have been proposed to address challenges posed by such datasets in this work we focus on the use of  regularized linear models in the context of possibly nonstationary streaming data recently it has been noted that the choice of the regularization parameter is fundamental in such models and several methods have been proposed which iteratively tune such a parameter in a timevarying manner thereby allowing the underlying sparsity of estimated models to vary moreover in many applications inference on the regularization parameter may itself be of interest as such a parameter is related to the underlying sparsity of the model however in this work we highlight and provide extensive empirical evidence regarding how various often unrelated statistical properties in the data can lead to changes in the regularization parameter in particular through various synthetic experiments we demonstrate that changes in the regularization parameter may be driven by changes in the true underlying sparsity signaltonoise ratio or even model misspecication the purpose of this letter is therefore to highlight and catalog various statistical properties which induce changes in the associated regularization parameter we conclude by presenting two applications one relating to nancial data and another to neuroimaging data where the aforementioned discussion is relevant  keywords  lasso penalty parameter

variance properties of bitcoin and gold as well as other assets and nd dierences in their structure secondly we implement a bekkgarch model to estimate timevarying conditional correlations gold plays an important role in nancial markets with  ighttoquality in times of market distress our results show that bitcoin behaves as the exact opposite and it positively correlates with downward markets lastly we analyze the properties of bitcoin as portfolio component and nd no evidence for hedging capabilities we conclude that bitcoin and gold feature fundamentally dierent properties as assets and linkages to equity markets our results hold for the broad cryptocurrency index crix as of now bitcoin does not re ect any distinctive properties of gold other than asymmetric response in variance

offered in various currencies however all markets trade one common good and by the law of one price the different prices should not deviate in the long run in this context we are interested in which platform is the most important one in terms of price discovery to this end we use a pairwise approach accounting for a potential impact of exchange rates the contribution to price discovery is measured by hasbroucks and gonzalo and grangers information share we then derive an ordering with respect to the importance of each market which reveals that the chinese okcoin platform is the leader in price discovery of bitcoin followed by btc china   keywords  price discovery bitcoin hasbrouck information shares   sep abstract data from social media has created opportunities to understand how and why people move through their urban environment and how this relates to criminal activity to aid resource allocation decisions in the scope of predictive policing the paper proposes an approach to predict weekly crime counts the novel approach captures spatial dependency of criminal activity through approximating human dynamics it integrates point of interest data in the form of foursquare venues with twitter activity and taxi trip data and introduces a set of approaches to create features from these data sources empirical results demonstrate the explanatory and predictive power of the novel features analysis of a sixmonth period of realworld crime data for the city of new york evidences that both temporal and static features are necessary to eectively account for human dynamics and

blockchainbased cryptocurrencies has received a considerable attention the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies has led many to speculate that the blockchain technology can surpass a traditional centralized monetary system however no monetary model has yet been de veloped to study the economics of the blockchain this paper builds a model of the economy with a single generally acepted blockchainbased currency in the spirit of the search and matching literature i use a matching function to model the operation of the blockchain the formulation of the money demand is taken from a workhorse of monetary economics  lagos and wright 2005 i show that in a blockchainbased monetary system money demand features a precautionary motive which is absent in the standard lagoswright model due to this precautionary money demand the monetary equilibrium can be stable for some calibrations i also used the developed model to study how the equilibrium return on money is  keywords

technologyoriented alliances by transferring technological knowledge as well as cognitive elements to the hiring firm mobile inventors foster the alignment of decision frames applied by potential alliance partners in the process of alliance formation thereby making collaboration more likely using data on inventor mobility and alliance formation amongst 42 global pharmaceutical firms over 16 years we show that inventor mobility is positively associated with the likelihood of alliance formation in periods following inventor movements this relationship becomes more pronounced if mobile employees bring additional knowledge about their prior firms technological capabilities and for alliances aimed at technology development rather than for agreements related to technology transfer it is weakened however if the focal firm is already familiar with the competitors technological capabilities by revealing these relationships our study contributes to research on alliance formation

currency provision and currency competi tion the outcome of cryptocurrency competition should be analyzed in a model which incorporates important features of the modern cryptocurren cies in this paper i focus on two such features first cryptocurrencies operate according to a protocol  a blockchain  and are therefore free from the timeinconsistency problem second the operation of the blockchain costs real resources i use the lagoswright search theoretic monetary model augmented with privately issued currencies as in fernandezvillaverde and sanches 2016 and extend it by linear costs of

testing for bubbles in cryptocurrencies with timevarying volatility christian m hafner abstract the recent evolution of cryptocurrencies has been characterized by bubblelike behavior and extreme volatility while it is difficult to assess an intrinsic value to a specific cryptocurrency one can employ recently proposed bubble tests that rely on recursive applications of classical unit root tests this paper extends this approach to the case where volatility is time varying assuming a deterministic longrun component that may take into account a decrease of unconditional volatility when the cryptocurrency matures with a higher market dissemination volatility also includes a stochastic shortrun component to capture volatility clustering the wild bootstrap is shown to correctly adjust the size properties of the bubble test which retains good power properties in an empirical application using eleven of the largest cryptocurrencies and the crix index the general evidence in favor of bubbles is confirmed but much less pronounced than under constant volatility keywords  cryptocurrencies speculative bubbles wild bootstrap volatility    sep abstract the crix cryptocurrency index has been constructed based on a number of cryptos and provides a high coverage of market liquidity huberlincrix the crypto currency market is a new asset market and attracts a lot of investors recently surprisingly a market for contingent claims hat not been built up yet a reason is certainly the lack of pricing tools that are based on solid financial econometric tools here a first step towards pricing of derivatives of this new asset class is presented after a careful econometric preanalysis we motivate an affine jump diffusion model ie the svcj stochastic volatility with correlated jumps model we calibrate svcj by mcmc and obtain interpretable jump processes and then via simulation price options the jumps present in the cryptocurrency fluctutations are an essential component concrete

highdimensional nonparametric approximations in objective functions when the dimension is high none of methods with penalization in the literature are readily available also ranking and screening approaches cannot have selection consistency when iterative algorithms cannot be used due to inefficient nonparametric approximation in this paper a novel and easily implemented approach is proposed to make existing methods feasible for selection with no need of nonparametric approximation selection consistency can be achieved as an application to additive regression models we then suggest a twostage procedure that separates selection and estimation steps an adaptive estimation to the smoothness of underlying components can be constructed such that the consistency can be even at parametric rate if the underlying model is really parametric simulations are carried out to examine the performance of our method and a real data example is analyzed for illustration   keywords

institutions and the stability of the economy one widely used financial risk measure is valueatrisk var var estimates based on linear and parametric models can lead to biased results or even underestimation of risk due to time varying volatility skewness and leptokurtosis of nancial return series the paper proposes a nonlinear and nonparametric framework to forecast var mean and volatility are modeled via support vector regression svr where the volatility model is motivated by the standard generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity garch formulation based on this var is derived by applying kernel density estimation kde this approach allows for  exible tail shapes of the profit and loss distribution and adapts for a wide class of tail events the
